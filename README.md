This script will identify the file extension, you can alternatively add your own extensions and their description according to the file type.

The generate_index function will store the path of your file and give it a 'max' index. The standard code will pull up to 100 records. If you would like to have unlimited records pulled the max variable needs to be set to 0.

The code will create a 'file_index' excel file with the 'df1' variable structure. User can add more columns with information required as needed.
